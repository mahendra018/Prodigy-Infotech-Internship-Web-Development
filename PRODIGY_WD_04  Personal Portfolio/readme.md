The hero section features a full-screen background image with introductory text and buttons, creating an engaging first impression for visitors.

### External Style and Script Links:
The code links to external CSS files (style.css and responsive.css) and JavaScript (script.js), which help in keeping the HTML clean and focused on structure.

### Font Awesome Integration:
Font Awesome icons are used throughout the site for visual enhancement, such as in the navigation bar, service icons, and social media links.

### Portfolio Section:
This section showcases different projects with titles and descriptions, arranged in a grid layout that adapts to screen size, making it visually appealing and informative.

### About Section:
The about section provides a brief overview of the individual's background and achievements, which helps visitors understand their experience and skills.

### Service Cards:
