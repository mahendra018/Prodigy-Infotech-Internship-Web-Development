The design is responsive, with smooth animations and intuitive interactions, making it both functional and visually appealing.

### Key Points:

### Intuitive User Interface:
The stopwatch has a simple, clean layout, making it easy for users to navigate and use without any confusion. Buttons are clearly labeled, and the time display is prominent.

The stopwatch includes subtle animations like the fade-in effect when the app loads and the scale effect on button clicks, adding a polished, professional feel to the user experience.

### Dynamic Time Display:
The time display updates dynamically, showing minutes, seconds, and milliseconds in real-time. This provides accurate and detailed timing, essential for a stopwatch.

### Lap Functionality:
Users can record lap times with a single click. Each lap is displayed in a list, allowing users to track their progress or compare different intervals during timing sessions.

### Modern Visual Design:
The color scheme uses dark backgrounds with light text and vibrant button colors, creating a modern, visually appealing look that is easy on the eyes.

### Interactive Feedback:
The stopwatch provides immediate feedback to user actions. For example, the start button changes to a pause button when clicked, and the buttons subtly scale on hover, indicating that the app is responsive to user input.

### Consistent Styling:
